# pxl_level_autoencoder


# Outline of next steps:

- Get the logistics and existing notebook running
- Get the VOC dataset running
- Try out contrastive learning for improving the feature space
- improve the clustering in the embedded space
- try out local smoothing in ae feature space

Sequence:
- unsupervised training of pxlwise ae, large dataset
- add supervised training on small labeled dataset from image segmentation
